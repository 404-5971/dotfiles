[control+shift]
# This is a composite layer that takes precedence when BOTH control and shift are held.
# We explicitly map h and l back to their original combinations using macros.
# This overrides the `h = left` mapping from the [control] layer and ensures
# the literal `ctrl+shift+h` combination is sent to the system.
